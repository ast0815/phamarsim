    Parameters
    ----------

        The speed of sound in the medium in m/s. Defaults to 331.3 m/s.
    
    Notes
    -----
    SimpleMediums only have to provide a constant speed of sound.

    ----------

        The medium's temperature in 째C. Defaults to 0.0 째C.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The speed of sound in dry air can be approximated with the formula

    This relation is true for all (approximately) ideal gases.
